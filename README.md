# file-operations-exercise
Three exercises working with text and binary files.

## Summary
The objective of these exercises was to have a better understanding of file handling in c language.

- **estructuraenarchivobinario.c** Program that obtains a password, name and age from three text files. The information is stored in memory with a struct, which is then written to a binary file.
- **sistemamateriastxt.c && sistemamateriasbin.c** Program that simulates a system of courses per student. A student can be registered in the system as well as his courses and grades. The student's data can be modified and it is also possible to delete the student. The data is read/stored in a text or binary file.

The interaction was performed in the console, where the user could choose the operation to be performed, as well as insert the data required or display the information obtained from the files.  

A main menu was simulated from which program operations could be performed.
It highlights the use of structs for data grouping, character arrays for string handling, read and write functions in files.
